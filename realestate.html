No wonder why the health clinic is right next to the gym! On this floor, you could also find a beautiful quilt. Made from the finest material, it was imported right from Panama. On this floor, you could also find the more political fellas. You could say they specialize in history and geography. Oh yeah, and this floor has literally the only escalator that works.
